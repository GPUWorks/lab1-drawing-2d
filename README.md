# lab1-drawing-2d
As part of the Computer Graphics module at the National University of Singapore, a 2D drawing was rendered with OpenGL, written in C++.

A competition was held for this assignment. This submission was voted first place and subsequently won some chocolates which were all eaten by my exchange friends ü¶Å.
